# Presentation for an R meetup in Prague in January 2023
The rendered presentation is in the quarto.html file which is to be opened using a browser. To see the example of the barchart race in the presentation, you need to use the quarto.qmd and serve it on the localhost (e.g. by rendering it in RStudio).
